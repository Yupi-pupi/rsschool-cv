### Experience:
*I started my working career in 2017 as a doctor, after graduating from Belarusian State Medical University. At first i worked at occupational health department of Minsk zonal centre for Hygiene and Epidemiology. The most interesting part of my job was working with documentation (compliance check) and composing of risk assessment reports. In 2019 i became a head of department and my main duties were supplemented by planning as well as working process management, task placement and delegation. As I am always looking for knowledge and studying, this lead me to RS School.*
